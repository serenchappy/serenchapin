      <h1>Object Final Project</h1>
      <p>My project teammates and I created a jacket that allows you to keep track of your hits when playing Ninja so that no one can cheat. Using a Lilypad soundboard and Adafruit V2 Floras we were able to provide players feedback on where they were hit on the body using capacitive touch and color. Using sounds like "wow", "game over man", and a reset noise-- players know where they are at in the game making it the ultimate user experience. The Adafruit V2 Floras are placed on both sides of the shirt, one side flashes with a color corresponding to the place you got hit and the other side keeps track of score using an array while also showing you the place you got hit using color.</p>
      <h2> Ideation </h2>
      <p> The first step for this project was to begin brainstorming what I was interested in. I have always been interested in learning how to sew yet never knew how to begin this big task. I thought this project was a good way to force myself to do it. Luckily, my partners had experience in sewing and were willing to take on this project with me. We began ideating the interactions for the jacket. I knew I wanted incorporate lights into the interaction and learn how to use a Lilypad Arduino or something like that. They wanted to incorporate sound into the project, however we were pretty flexible on how we wanted to trigger those outputs. I began drawing out different clothing items we could make and how we could incorporate all of these things. </p>

      <h2> Prototyping</h2>
      <p> The prototyping phase included patterning the shirt, finding out the best way to make the capactive touch, working with the Adafruit Flora V2s and conductive thread, and testing the soundboard and arduino.</p>

      <h2>Final Product</h2>
      <p> For our final product we were able to get a fully working shirt. I am excited to build on this project in the future and it has further inspired me to really start getting using to working with a sewing machine. Thank you to my TA's Suraj and Caleb for working with me in labs and always being there when I had questions and thank you to my teacher Laura for inspiring me to make wearables!</p>
